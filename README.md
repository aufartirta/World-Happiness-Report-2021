# World Happiness Report 2021
## Project Overview

### Objective:
The project aims to build a dashboard for the World Happiness Index 2021, visualizing various factors that influence happiness across different countries.
Data Sources: The dashboard uses data from the World Happiness Report 2021 by the United Nations.

### Key Metrics:
The dashboard focuses on metrics such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, perception of corruption, freedom to make life choices, social support, and generosity.

## Key Findings
1. Dominance of European Countries: The happiest countries are predominantly European, whereas the least happy countries are mainly in Africa.

7. Weak Correlation of Generosity: Generosity shows a weak correlation with happiness scores, indicating that while it is a positive trait, it does not significantly impact overall happiness levels.

## Conclusions
1. Challenges in Developing Countries: Developing countries often face issues such as low GDP, low life expectancy, high levels of government corruption, limited freedom to make life choices, and insufficient social support. These factors are directly correlated with lower happiness levels.
2. Advantages in Developed Countries: Developed countries typically experience fewer of these problems, contributing to higher happiness levels.
3. Policy Implications: Policymakers in developing countries should focus on improving economic conditions, healthcare systems, governance, and social support structures to enhance overall happiness levels.
   * Economic stability, indicated by consistent GDP growth and low inflation rates, is crucial for sustaining high happiness levels.
   * Improving healthcare and increasing life expectancy are essential for boosting happiness, highlighting the need for accessible and quality healthcare services.
   * Social support is a critical factor in determining happiness. Countries with robust social networks and community support systems tend to report higher happiness levels.
   * The ability to make life choices freely is a significant contributor to happiness. Enhancing personal freedoms and reducing restrictions can positively impact happiness levels.
   * Reducing corruption and increasing transparency in government operations build trust among citizens and contribute to higher happiness levels.

## Recommendations
1. Sustainable Development Goals: Sustainable development goals that focus on economic, social, and environmental well-being can have a lasting positive impact on happiness. These include:
   * Promoting economic growth and stability.
   * Improving healthcare and increasing life expectancy.
   * Reducing corruption and enhancing government transparency.
   * Strengthening social support systems.
   * Ensuring freedom and personal autonomy.
   * Encouraging environmental sustainability and addressing climate change.
2. Integrated Policy Approaches: Develop integrated policies that address economic, health, and social factors simultaneously to create a holistic improvement in happiness levels.
3. International Collaboration: Foster international cooperation to share best practices and resources for achieving sustainable development and enhancing global happiness.
